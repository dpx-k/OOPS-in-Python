# Introduction to OOPS

Object Oriented Programming is a way of computer programming using the idea of "objects" to represent data and methods. it is also, an approach used for creating neat and reusable code instead of a redundant one

## Difference between oops and procedural programming 

## Problems in Procedure Oriented Approach
Lack of Modularity 
Lack of resusability 
Debugging 

## Classes and Objects 
### Class 
1. exists in the real world and can be distinguised form other 
2. Collection of objects 
3. Blueprit of objects 

### Objects
1. 

## Encapsulation 
Data(variables) and the code(methods) that act on the data are bind together

## Abstraction 
hides complex implementation details while exposing only essential information and functionalities to users. 

## Inheritance 
inherting or transfer of characteristics from parent ot child class without any modification 

## Polymorphism 
Represents the ability to assume many forms
