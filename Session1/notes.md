# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data and methods. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and organization, making software development more efficient and scalable.

## Differences Between OOP and Procedural Programming

| Feature        | Procedural Programming       | Object-Oriented Programming  |
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Approach**   | Follows a step-by-step procedure | Organizes code into objects |
| **Modularity** | Code is divided into functions | Code is divided into objects and classes |
| **Reusability** | Limited reusability | High reusability through inheritance and polymorphism |
| **Data Security** | Data is accessible globally | Data is encapsulated within objects |

## Problems in the Procedural-Oriented Approach

1. **Lack of Modularity** – Functions and data are not grouped together, leading to less organized code.
2. **Lack of Reusability** – Code duplication is common, making maintenance difficult.
3. **Debugging Challenges** – Changes in one part of the program may affect other parts.

## Classes and Objects

### Class
- Exists in the real world and can be distinguished from others.
- A collection of objects.
- Acts as a blueprint for objects.

### Object
- An instance of a class that holds data and methods.
- Represents a real-world entity.

## Core Concepts of OOP

### Encapsulation
- Binds data (variables) and the methods that act on the data together.
- Restricts direct access to some components, improving security.

### Abstraction
- Hides complex implementation details while exposing only essential information and functionalities to users.

### Inheritance
- Enables a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent) without modification.

### Polymorphism
- Represents the ability of an object to take multiple forms.
- Allows the same interface to be used for different underlying data types.
